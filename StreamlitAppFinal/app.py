Have you ever been caught, unsure of what to put on the radio? Wether you want to listen to some slow jazz, 
some up beat pop, maybe rap? Well, look no further! In this app, you are able to either take a peak 
at what others are listening to OR get recommendations based on your mood. As you can see from below, there
is a data set filled with different songs, artists, genres, etc, that will provide some inspiration, but if thats
not enough, scroll over to the second tab to take a mood quiz. From there, take your mood to the recommendations tab 
and find what songs go best with your mood!
