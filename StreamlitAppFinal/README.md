# Whats Your Jam? 🎶🎤

## **Project Overview 📖📋:**
This project touches on a variety of skills. Through the use of spaCy and streamlit, as well as a variety of Python functions, I clean data, create quizzes, and improve interaction between data and users. More specifically, this app allows users to better look at music data, analyzing what makes songs different, such as tempo, loudness, energy, etc., and how that then feeds into one’s mood/vibe. The app accomplishes this by allowing users to take a quiz, find their mood, and then find songs that fit perfectly with the mood. Overall, through this app, I really wanted to allow for interaction with users and data as well as add a touch of fun to discovering new music!

- [🎧 Spotify Tracks Dataset by Maharshi Pandya on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset)

This app looks at tens of thousands of songs, which is a ton of data. In order to find that data, Kaggle was an incredible help! Below is the Spotify Track Data site, which I input, allowing me to look at different songs and provide music for the audience.


## **Learn More 💡👩‍🎓**
Below are some resources I found that helped me during this project!

- [Real Python 👩‍💻](https://realpython.com/python-quiz-application/)

When I was trying to create my mini mood quiz, I was at a bit of a loss where to start. However, by reading Real Python’s "Build a Quiz Application With Python," I was able to learn a little more. It provided a good building foundation on which I could build my own quiz. It also provided some good context for any other quizzes I might be interested in doing in the future!
