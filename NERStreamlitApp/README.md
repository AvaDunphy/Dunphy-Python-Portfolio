# Named Entity Recogition (NER) App Project 

### Project Overview 📖📋
This app provides users with the opprotunity to look further into Named Entity Recognition, employing spaCy and Streamlit to enhance entity patterns, upload text, and organize highlighted entities. In this project, I establish my own patterns, definitions, and forms, through the use of if statements, label, pattern, and additional entities. 

### Step by Step Process! 🥇🥈🥉

**What to do:**
1. Write your own text in the text box **or** upload a `.txt` file.
2. Specify the custom **label** and **pattern** you are looking for.
3. Click **Run NER** to highlight entities instantly!

## App Features 
* spaCy 
* Entity 
* Dictionaries 
* Text/File/HTML Uploads 

## References 👩‍💻🖥️
Initally when looking through this project, I was slightly lost. However, I looked through some other fellow Github users projects to gain a better understanding of Named Entity Recognition, and I found them to be very helpful. Below find the link to their page if intrested! 

- [GLiNER: GitHub Repository by urchade](https://github.com/urchade/GLiNER) – A generalized, lightweight NER model for low-resource settings.

## Learn More 💡👩‍🎓
Below find some resources that I used which helped me a lot while try to create/accomplish this project. 

- [spaCy EntityRecognizer API Documentation](https://spacy.io/api/entityrecognizer)") 
In this website you are able to can read about different locations and values of assigned attributes in entity recognizer (which we didn't really cover in this project). However, I still think it was important for providing some background understanding. Overall, this site opened me up to some new ways to play around with spaCy and Entity Recognizer. 

- [spaCy Named Entities Overview](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#named-entities)")
This website also provided some god background information. It was a little more straight forward to follow, which was a lot of help, but it does a fantastic job of walking you through different code AND allowing for you to mess around with the code to further your understanding. It mainly helped me with visualozaing and working with patterns, which was important for this project.
