# Named Entity Recogition (NER) App Project 

### Project Overview 📖📋
This app provides users with the opportunity to look further into Named Entity Recognition, employing spaCy and Streamlit to enhance entity patterns, upload text, and organize highlighted entities. In this project, I establish my own patterns, definitions, and forms, through the use of if statements, labels, patterns, and additional entities. 

### Step by Step Process! 🥇🥈🥉

**What to do:**
1. Write your own text in the text box **or** upload a `.txt` file.
2. Specify the custom **label** and **pattern** you are looking for.
3. Click **Run NER** to highlight entities instantly!

### Then, you can add specific parameters for the patterns and labels you want to apply.

## References 👩‍💻🖥️
Initially, when looking through this project, I was slightly lost. However, I looked through some other fellow Github user’s projects to gain a better understanding of Named Entity Recognition, and I found them to be very helpful. Below, find the link to their page if you are interested!  

- [GLiNER: GitHub Repository by urchade](https://github.com/urchade/GLiNER) – A generalized, lightweight NER model for low-resource settings.

## Learn More 💡👩‍🎓
Below are some resources I found that helped me better understand Entity Recognition.  

- [spaCy EntityRecognizer API Documentation](https://spacy.io/api/entityrecognizer)") 
This website, you are able to read about different locations and values of assigned attributes in entity recognizer (which we didn't cover in this project). However, I still think it was important to provide some background. Overall, this site opened me up to some new ways to play around with spaCy and Entity Recognizer. 

- [spaCy Named Entities Overview](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#named-entities)")
This website also provided some good background information. It was a little easier to follow, which was a lot of help, but it does a fantastic job of walking you through different code AND allowing you to mess around with the code to further your understanding. It mainly helped me with visualizing and working with patterns, which was important for this project.
