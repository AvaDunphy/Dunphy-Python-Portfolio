# Named Entity Recogition (NER) App Project 

### Project Overview ðŸ“–
This app provides users with the opprotunity to look further into Named Entity Recognition, employing spaCy and Streamlit to enhance entity patterns, upload text, and organize highlighted entities. In this project, I establish my own patterns, definitions, and forms, through the use of if statements, label, pattern, and additional entities. 

### Step by Step Process! ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥ˆðŸ¥‰

**What to do:**
1. Write your own text in the text box **or** upload a `.txt` file.
2. Specify the custom **label** and **pattern** you are looking for.
3. Click **Run NER** to highlight entities instantly!

## App Features

Initally when looking through this project, I was slightly lost. However, I looked through some other fellow Github users projects to gain a better understanding of Named Entity Recognition, and I found them to be very helpful. Below find the link to their page if intrested!
