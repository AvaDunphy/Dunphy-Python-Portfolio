# Named Entity Recogition (NER) App Project 

Project Overview 📖
This app provides users with the opprotunity to look further into Named Entity Recognition, employing spaCy and Streamlit to enhance entity patterns, upload text, and organize highlighted entities. In this project, I establish my own patterns, definitions, and forms, through the use of if statements, label, pattern, and additional entities. 

How To 🔍
