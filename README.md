# Ava Dunphy Python Portfolio 
## Purpose 🔨
This file contains a variety of my works in data science, showcasing my projects using the python language. It includes some different programming techniques, data processing methods, and problem-solving approaches I've explored. I have up load a variety of my works as from my most recent attempts. Below find some brief descriptions of my work, and they have complimented by overall learning experience. 

Skills: Python, R-Studio, spaCy, Streamlit


## [Tidying Up Project!](https://github.com/AvaDunphy/Dunphy-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/Tidy%20Up%20Project) 🧹
## 2008 Olympics Data Clean 🏆🧗‍♀️🏂
In this project, I looked at the 2008 Olympic Medalist data. Though the data was quite interesting and provided a significant amount of information regarding which athletes competed, if they received medals, and/or what medals they did receive, the information was not organized. It would've been difficult to find more specific pieces of the data or simply gain a better holistic understanding. In this project, I used techniques such as ".melt(), "str.split()", or "str.replace()" to better organize the data and make it more presentable. In addition to this, I used a bar, a histogram, and a heat graph plot to create visualizations of the data, once again making it easier on the eye. Finally, I created a pivot plot, which allowed me to compare different aspects of the data, looking closer at specific values and groups. Overall, this whole project taught me how to dive deeper into data sheets, restructure them, and improve their visual appeal. 


## [Name Entity Project!](https://github.com/AvaDunphy/Dunphy-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/NERStreamlitApp) 👋
## Name Entity Recognition 📸
In this project I tied together my knowledge and understanding of entitties, and the combinations of Python, spaCy and streamlit, to develop a Named Entiy Recognition application. Through this app, I am able to allow users to upload text, data, html files, etc, and view their highlighted entities (which I deemed variable in my personal entity labels/rules). This way, I am able to recongize key features of users uploads, as well as bring attention to any particular issue areas of the text/data. This project allowed me to improve my python abilities, and begin the process of deciding what I want to do with my own code. The freedom of this project allowed me to develop my own rules and guidelines, pushing my creatiity and coding ability.
