# Ava Dunphy Python Portfolio 
#### Purpose 🔨
This file contains a variety of my works in data science, showcasing my projects using the python language. It includes some different programming techniques, data processing methods, and problem-solving approaches I've explored. I have up load a variety of my works as from my most recent attempts. Below find some brief descriptions of my work, and they have complimented by overall learning experience. 

Skills Throughout: 
❐ Python
❐ R-Studio
❐ spaCy
❐ Streamlit


## [Tidying Up Project!](https://github.com/AvaDunphy/Dunphy-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/Tidy%20Up%20Project) 🧹
### 2008 Olympics Data Clean 🏆🧗‍♀️🏂
In this project, I looked at the 2008 Olympic Medalist data. Though the data was quite interesting and provided a significant amount of information regarding which athletes competed, if they received medals, and/or what medals they did receive, the information was not organized. It would've been difficult to find more specific pieces of the data or simply gain a better holistic understanding. In this project, I used techniques such as ".melt(), "str.split()", or "str.replace()" to better organize the data and make it more presentable. In addition to this, I used a bar, a histogram, and a heat graph plot to create visualizations of the data, once again making it easier on the eye. Finally, I created a pivot plot, which allowed me to compare different aspects of the data, looking closer at specific values and groups. Overall, this whole project taught me how to dive deeper into data sheets, restructure them, and improve their visual appeal. 

Skills: Python

## [Named Entity Project!](https://github.com/AvaDunphy/Dunphy-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/NERStreamlitApp) 👋
### NER 📸
In this project, I tied together my knowledge and understanding of entities, and the combinations of Python, spaCy, and Streamlit, to develop a Named Entity Recognition application. Through this app, I can allow users to upload text, data, html files, etc, and view their highlighted entities (which I deemed variable in my personal entity labels/rules). This way, I am able to recognize key features of users’ uploads, as well as bring attention to any particular issue areas of the text/data. This project allowed me to improve my Python abilities, and begin the process of deciding what I want to do with my code. The freedom of this project allowed me to develop my own rules and guidelines, pushing my creativity and coding ability.

Skills: spaCy & Streamlit

## [What's Your Jam?](https://github.com/AvaDunphy/Dunphy-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/StreamlitAppFinal) 🎸
### Final Project 🎷
In this project, I tied together the various techniques I learned throughout the semester to find data, upload it to GitHub, clean it up, create interaction opportunities, and more. This project really tested my skills, improving my ability to use spaCy and Streamlit, and create a more interactive and exciting project. Through this project, users can look at different types of songs and can narrow them down based on track genres, artists, loudness, tempo, speechiness, etc. Additionally, if they are unsure what kind of mood they are in and what songs they should listen to, they have the chance to take a mood quiz and then be given 6 songs assoicated with that mood. Additionally, the app provides YouTube links to each song for easy access. Overall, this apps allows an easy and fun way to discover new music on their own terms. 

Skills: spaCy, Streamlit, Dictionaries, File Uploads.
